This file exists so that a potential .exe file can verify that it, in fact, is an .exe 
file. It does this by checking if this file exists in its `.` directory. If it does, it 
means that it's been build inside of the .exe ... or that someone has placed it in its 
directory. Until we find a better solution, just don't name anything `exe_identifier`, and 
then place it in the program's `.` directory...
